# Diffusion attention execution contract PoC

This prototype accompanies [RFC #7226](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-omni/issues/7226)
and extends the [attention selection design](attention_backend_selection.md).
It demonstrates path-specific capabilities with dense BF16 FA4, NPU/ROCm
routing examples, and tensor-state lifetime with a test-only attention module.

## Execution contract

`ExecutionContext` describes the requested execution path. `ExecutionPathResult`
reports its identity, support status and reason, and compilation mode.
`AttentionBackend.resolve_capabilities()` provides conservative pre-construction
results. After initialization, `Attention.resolve_execution_path()` supplies the
active parallel, paged-KV, and HSDP context; the backend combines it with the
selected kernel and normalized metadata. For a layer built with
[attention schedule](../../user_guide/diffusion/attention_backends/schedules.md)
profiles configured, it also supplies the `ATTENTION_SCHEDULE` boundary, because
that layer's attention call runs eagerly under `torch.compile`, and it resolves
the implementation selected at that moment: the one prepared for the profile
that the schedule selects at the published denoise step, otherwise the base
implementation. FA4 therefore reports `UNMIGRATED` and `EAGER_ONLY` for such a
layer.

Resolution runs outside compiled execution. FA4 reports `SUPPORTED` and
`CUSTOM_OP` for dense, noncausal BF16 without parallel, HSDP, or attention
schedule boundaries when its kernel accepts the head dimensions. Dimension
validation delegates to FA4's architecture-specific rules through
`backends/utils/fa.py`. Kernel rejections report `UNSUPPORTED` with an
actionable reason. Missing private validators and other unmigrated paths report
`UNMIGRATED` with advisory `EAGER_ONLY` defaults. `requested_support()` checks a
fullgraph request; it does not enforce selection or change existing execution.

FA4 execution uses an opaque custom op. Its fake output preserves Q's batch,
sequence, and head count and uses V's head dimension. Output is contiguous even
when Q is noncontiguous. Metadata normalization is
shared with dispatch. Producers must update published mask semantics when masks
change; unpublished masks remain runtime-dependent to avoid synchronization.
Callers resolve again when execution metadata changes.

## NPU and ROCm worked examples

The same `FLASH_ATTN` backend resolves MindIE paths on NPU and AITER paths on
ROCm. Both examples report `UNMIGRATED`: their route is inspected, while hardware
correctness and compilation remain unvalidated. `EAGER_ONLY` is an advisory
default, not a measured compiler limitation. Existing execution is unchanged.

| Input | NPU / MindIE | ROCm / AITER |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dense | `npu_dense` | `rocm_dense` |
| Padding mask | `npu_masked`: expand the key mask to `[B, 1, Q, K]` | `rocm_masked_varlen`: unpad, call varlen attention, then restore rows |
| Packed inputs | Opt-in `[real, pad]` contract; choose varlen or prefix-KV slicing from the environment | Forward complete packed-document boundaries to varlen attention |
| Incomplete packing | Rebuild a mask when possible; otherwise reject before the kernel | Shared CUDA-like normalization rejects incomplete metadata |
| Unpublished mask semantics | Route to the masked wrapper | Keep resolution runtime-dependent without reading mask values |

NPU resolution reuses `_resolve_packed_seq_npu`; ROCm reuses the metadata
normalization used by dispatch. AITER identity comes from initialization rather
than caller-provided context. Quantized, paged, piecewise, and parallel paths
remain outside these worked examples.

The new L1 tests use CPU tensors and replace only vendor kernel calls. They
check path identity, forwarded masks/boundaries, fallback rejection, and
conservative fullgraph-request handling. They do not test vendor numerics or
compiler support. Existing L1 CI already collects this test file.

```bash
python -m pytest tests/diffusion/attention/test_flash_attn.py \
  -k 'npu_contract or rocm_contract' -m 'core_model and cpu' -q
```

### Hardware validation required before migration

On an Ascend/MindIE or ROCm/AITER runner, record device, driver, PyTorch, vendor
library, and compiler versions, then validate the corresponding rows above:

1. Compare eager outputs with FP32 SDPA for dense and padding-mask inputs,
   including unequal Q/K lengths. Compare valid query rows; do not assume both
   platforms define padded-query outputs identically.
2. Compare packed outputs with separate per-document references. On NPU, cover
   both varlen and laser prefix-slicing modes, plus mask reconstruction and the
   missing-mask error. A padding fallback does not establish multi-document
   isolation. On ROCm, cover multiple real documents.
3. Check output shape, dtype, device, finite values, and unchanged inputs.
   Start BF16 comparisons at `atol=rtol=1e-2` and have the platform maintainer
   confirm the tolerance against its reference tests.
4. Run `torch.compile(fullgraph=True, dynamic=True)` with the platform's supported
   compiler over multiple sequence lengths. Record graph breaks and recompiles;
   choose `TRACEABLE`, `CUSTOM_OP`, or verified `EAGER_ONLY` from that evidence.
   A custom-op path additionally needs schema/fake checks and repeated replay.

Promote only the paths validated on that platform. These hardware checks have
not been run locally; ROCm/NPU fullgraph support is not claimed.

## State lifetime example

`test_attention_state_lifetime.py` prepares an owned query-scale tensor eagerly
and passes it explicitly to an opaque attention op. The compiled module retains
its state after the caller drops its reference and releases ownership when the
compiled callable is deleted. Equivalent instances reuse a graph with their own
state values.

This example tests ownership and release, dynamic replay across instances,
custom-op schema/fake behavior, and Inductor execution. It adds no production
backend or state registry. Planning keys, caching, fallback-policy declarations,
opaque handles, CUDA graph capture, and TRTLLM integration are deferred.

## Validation

```bash
python -m pytest tests/diffusion/attention/test_flash_attn_compile.py \
  tests/diffusion/attention/test_flash_attn.py \
  tests/diffusion/attention/test_attention_capabilities.py \
  tests/diffusion/attention/test_attention_state_lifetime.py -q -rs
```

The focused suite covers capability decisions and metadata changes, existing
padding/mask regressions, tensor-state lifetime, and real FA4 fullgraph execution
against FP32 SDPA and eager FA4. Representative Q/K and V dimensions are
(32, 32), (64, 64), (80, 48), (192, 128), and (256, 256), with batches 1 and 2
and sequence lengths up to 1,024. Invalid dimensions are checked against actual
kernel errors. These samples exercise the contract rather than define support.
BF16 comparisons use `atol=rtol=1e-2`; `torch.library.opcheck` checks schema and
fake-output correctness.

Single-graph reuse is asserted in the tensor-state test. The FA4 numerical tests
retain compiler caches across shapes within each case but do not require one
graph across different batch sizes, Q/K length equality, or head dimensions.

Tested environment: GB300, PyTorch `2.13.0+cu130`, FA4 `4.0.0b18`, CUTLASS DSL
`4.6.2` with CUDA 13 libraries, Quack `0.6.4`, and TVM FFI `0.1.11`.
Real-kernel tests require CUDA and CuTe FA4; their availability is checked at runtime.

Before the rebase, the focused suite passed all 97 tests without skips, including
11 CPU NPU/ROCm routing tests. After rebasing onto upstream `e3be42e05`, the
expanded suite reports 99 passed and 11 failed in the local vLLM 0.28 environment.
All 11 failures are import errors: upstream now requires `compute_layout_strides`
from vLLM, which this environment lacks. Both noncontiguous FA4 regression cases
and real-kernel schema/fake checks pass. The full suite must be rerun with the
vLLM version required by upstream. NPU/ROCm device numerics and compilation remain
unvalidated. Pre-commit passes with the CI hook skips. Upstream PyTorch/CUTLASS
warnings remain.

## TRTLLM dense execution

`TRTLLM_ATTN` declares `SUPPORTED` / `CUSTOM_OP` for noncausal dense BF16 on
B200/GB200 (SM100) and B300/GB300 (SM103), head dimension 128, and equal Q/K/V
head counts, without parallel, paged-KV, piecewise, or HSDP boundaries. Pre-construction, SAGE, skip-softmax, packed,
and other unverified paths remain `UNMIGRATED`. Resolution and dispatch share
metadata validation; workspace mutation is explicit in the custom-op schema.

CPU contract tests cover fullgraph replay and schema/fake consistency using a
substituted dispatcher. Real-kernel validation requires Blackwell with FlashInfer:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/diffusion/attention/test_trtllm_attn.py \
  -k dense_contract_fullgraph_matches_sdpa -q -rs
```

These hardware tests compare eager/compiled output with FP32 SDPA and check
schema/fake agreement. The TRTLLM and contract suite passed on Blackwell before the final architecture
restriction was added: 61 passed, no skips (19 dependency deprecation warnings).
The SM100/SM103 restriction is additionally covered by CPU contract tests.
